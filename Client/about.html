    <h2>Andrew Kroll</h2>
    <p>Hey! I’m Andrew Kroll and I have been a professional photographer for a little over a year now, but I have been taking pictures since I was 16. I am working on my Bachelor’s degree in Integrated Strategic Communications with an emphasis on Advertising, and I am minoring in Multimedia. I hope to eventually become a freelance photographer, and co-owning an Advertising Firm. <br><br>
    We have been lucky enough to work with a number of the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire’s choirs and ensembles such as, The Singing Statesmen, the universities tenor bass acapella group, The Innocent Men, and their SATB group, Impromptu Acapella. I have been doing a bunch of freelance work for The Growler Guys, an tap house in Eau Claire. I also did a shoot for an engagement, and we will both be shooting a wedding during the winter of 2023. <br><br>
    I am primarily a portrait photographer, both candid and posed. Producing a picture that I am proud of sharing, and one that my client is proud to be apart of is incredibly important to me and my style. <br><br>
    I hope you decide to work with us!</p>

    <h2>Mitch Pettijohn</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Mitch Pettijohn and I have been a professional photographer for a year and a half. Photography has been a hobby of mine since I was 15. I am currently working on my Bachelor’s degree in Integrated Strategic Communications with an emphasis on Advertising, and I am minoring in Marketing. I hope to eventually become a freelance photographer on the side, and run an Advertising Firm with Andrew!<br><br>
    As Andrew stated before we have been able to work with the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire’s premiere tenor bass choir, The Singing Statesmen, and the universities tenor bass acapella group, The Innocent Men! I have also done multiple high school senior photo shoots and family pictures. We will also be shooting a wedding during the winter of 2023.<br><br>a
    I primarily take group photos because I like the dynamic of multiple people in a picture rather than separate. Seeing how people interact helps me figure out how to best capture the moment.<br><br>
    I hope you decide to work with us!</p>
